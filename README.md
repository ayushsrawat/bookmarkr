```bash
Files : A minimal file & folder manager

Ideas : Create backend for persistence
      : Tree View
      : Search in files
      : Handling of recursive rendering efficiently
      : Configure iosevka font

Pivot : I often find very insightful resources online in form of article(html), research papers (pdfs), books (pdfs), and many other
      : Basically my own way of bookmarking resources such that i can find that on every single device i am on without much configurations...
      : All the resources will be having the credits to the original author.
      : I don't own any of these resources, they are just the way of storing all of them in a proper organized way and for effecient searching.
      :rename to library, as library makes more sense than files & folders
```
